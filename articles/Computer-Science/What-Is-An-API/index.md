## What Is An Api

An API is a list of commands as well as the format of those commands that one program can send to another. It is used so that individual programs can communicate with one another directly and use each other's functions.

For instance, Notepad can communicate with the operating system (Windows) by telling it to print a document. It can do this in a number of ways but the most basic form is:

print(document);

This ability is useful in many ways. For one, it allows the Notepad program to be able to print without having to communicate directly with the printer. All the work in communicating, sharing and allocating what gets to print what is done by Windows. All an individual program needs to do is execute the print() command.

This ability is also useful in that Windows can easily change how it deals with different prints or whether it actually prints at all (rather than, say, save to a PDF document) without having to make any changes to Notepad.

API's are provided by any program that allows interaction with other programs. People who write programs but wishes to use the functionality that already exist in other programs can simply look at the API documentation to find the list of commands available to them.

In the context of the web, the API's generally allow you to send commands to programs running on the servers that you connect to from your browser or with the browser itself. This allows you to access resources only available on the server (for instance, logins and passwords).
